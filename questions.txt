When we are going to use mutex to protect a struct
should i create mutex for every single properties or one global lock ?

are mutexes being used only for write ? or every where which we use write and
read should be wrapped by mutex?

and how do you test this kind of stuffs ? because they will work fine under normal load
, problem is when they are serving more users
